Supermarket Pricing

In this kata, we want you to implement a supermarket pricing application
in order to show:
 your IT skills
 you implementation style
 your work method that should be up to professional standard

The problem domain is pricing a basket of goods at supermarkets. Some
things have simple prices: this can of beans costs $0.65. Other things
have more complex prices. For example:
 three for a dollar (so what’s the price if I buy 4, or 5?)
 $1.99/pound (so what does 4 ounces cost?)
 buy two, get one free (so does the third item have a price?)
